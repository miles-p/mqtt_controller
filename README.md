# mqtt_controller
A GUI for a 4 channel MQTT controller.


### How to use ###

If you installed Python to PATH, good.
If you don't know what this is, then you just breezed through the Python installer.

Tkinter comes pre-installed to Python, so you're good with that, but Paho-MQTT requires you to run 'pip install paho-mqtt' in Command Prompt.

### How to configure ###

In the code, you will find 4 variables that you can change accordingly to the topic you want to send "ON" and "OFF" to.
